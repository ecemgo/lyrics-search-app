# Lyrics Search App

## Overview

This is an app where users can search for lyrics by entering the name of an artist or song title. These are listed through the Fetch API depending on the keyword entered. Unfortunately, Lyrics.ovh used as an API is not working, so even if users reach the list, they will not be able to access the lyrics when they want to get the lyrics from the list. Consequently, the app will be updated when a similar service API is found.

## The process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Fetch API
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Public Demo Server](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/301) - It helped me to find and use a new public demo server because cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com has not worked for a while.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/) - Brad Traversy's course called '20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript' helped me to understand the concept.
- [Flex Direction Column](https://dirask.com/posts/CSS-justify-content-in-flexbox-flex-direction-column-DNbAJD), [Flex Direction Row](https://dirask.com/posts/CSS-justify-content-in-flexbox-flex-direction-row-1enA8D) - It helped me to understand the flex directions and it considerably avoided confusion.
- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-content) - It helped me to understand the flexbox concept and apply the necessary features.
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/pirrera/pen/bqVeGx) - It helped me to give the style to the buttons.
